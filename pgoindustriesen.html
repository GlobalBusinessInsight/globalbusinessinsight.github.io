    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Corporate Blue -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: Designed a single-page application (SPA) using a main tabbed-pane (horizontal navigation) structure. This was chosen over a simple linear report to allow for non-linear, user-driven exploration. The user can immediately select their industry of interest. A central, dynamic content pane is updated (HTML + Chart.js) by a single JavaScript function, providing an integrated and responsive experience. This structure is ideal for presenting discrete, parallel solution sets (one per industry) clearly and concisely. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info (Solution for Industry X) -> Goal (Inform/Compare) -> Viz/Method (HTML Text, HTML Grid Cards, HTML Flex-Flowchart, Chart.js Bar Chart) -> Interaction (Click tab to update all content, hover chart for tooltip) -> Justification (This mix provides a clear hierarchy: high-level challenges, specific solutions (cards), a visual process (flowchart), and a quantitative benefit (chart). The HTML flowchart avoids SVG/Mermaid. The Chart.js bar chart (Before/After) is a reusable, data-driven element. All elements are dynamically loaded into a single pane for a seamless SPA feel.) -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
