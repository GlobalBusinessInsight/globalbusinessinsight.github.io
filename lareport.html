    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed left-hand navigation sidebar. This allows users to easily jump between key thematic sections (Timeline, Key Players, Impact, Root Causes) without a long, linear scroll. This non-linear, thematic structure breaks down the complex event into digestible parts, allowing users to explore what interests them most. The goal is to facilitate understanding by organizing information by its function (chronology, comparison, impact analysis) rather than the report's original narrative order, which is better for usability and exploration. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Timeline (Chronology): Report Info: Day-by-day events from June 6-12 with embedded videos. Goal: Show rapid escalation visually. Viz/Method: Interactive horizontal timeline using HTML/CSS/JS with an iframe for video. Interaction: Clicking a day reveals detailed info and corresponding video. Justification: More engaging and visually representative of time than a list. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Key Players (Comparison): Report Info: Expanded responses from federal, state, city gov. Goal: Compare conflicting stances in detail. Viz/Method: Interactive expandable cards. Interaction: Clicking a card expands it to show detailed text. Justification: Clearer and more interactive than a static table. Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Impact (Data Visualization): Report Info: Arrest numbers, economic costs, national spread. Goal: Visualize scale of impact. Viz/Method: Bar chart (arrests) and Donut chart (costs). Interaction: Hover tooltips. Justification: Provides a quick, powerful summary of quantitative data. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Root Causes & Solutions (Organization): Report Info: Expanded analysis of conflicts and proposed reforms. Goal: Organize complex text logically. Viz/Method: Tabbed component. Interaction: Clicking tabs switches content. Justification: Manages a large amount of text in a user-driven format. Library: Vanilla JS. -->

    economicImpact: `
        <h4>National Protest Contagion</h4>
        <p>The confrontation in Los Angeles quickly became a national flashpoint, inspiring a wave of solidarity protests in at least a dozen other U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, and Austin. This replication of conflict dynamics across other "sanctuary" jurisdictions highlighted a national map of potential flashpoints where the federal government's enforcement-heavy agenda could collide with local political opposition.</p>
        
        <h4 class="mt-4">Economic Disruption & Labor Shortages</h4>
        <p>The crisis revealed the U.S. economy's profound reliance on immigrant labor. The fear induced by the raids caused significant absenteeism in key California sectors:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Farmworker absenteeism spiked to 25-45% in some areas, directly threatening harvests for a state that supplies over a third of the country's vegetables and three-quarters of its fruits.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction & Hospitality:</strong> Economists warned of critical labor shortages, projecting suppressed job growth, diminished housing production, and rising consumer prices that could fuel inflation and potentially trigger a recession.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Damage to Global Image</h4>
        <p>At a time when Los Angeles was preparing to host the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics, the images of urban chaos tarnished the city's reputation. Analysts warned this narrative of "disaster" would deter tourism and investment, undermining efforts to present a welcoming face to the world. The Mexican national soccer team even relocated its hotel from downtown L.A. due to the unrest, a tangible sign of the reputational damage.</p>
    `,
    roots: {
        tensions: `
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">1. Federal Supremacy vs. States' Rights</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">A classic constitutional struggle. The federal government asserts its supreme authority over immigration law, while "sanctuary" states like California invoke the 10th Amendment to refuse cooperation, creating a legal and political standoff that formed the central battleground of the crisis.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">2. National Security vs. Community Policing</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">Two mutually exclusive law enforcement models clashed. The federal government framed immigration as a national security threat, justifying militarized tactics. Local authorities argued for a community policing model based on trust, which federal actions directly undermined by making residents fearful of all law enforcement.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">3. The Economic "Liberal Paradox"</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">A core contradiction in the U.S. system: its economy is heavily reliant on immigrant labor, yet its political system is susceptible to populist movements demanding restrictive policies. The raids were a stark example of a political agenda inflicting harm on economic necessity, disrupting vital industries like agriculture and construction.</p>

             <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">4. The Legal Gray Area of Executive Power</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">The administration used a legally "murky" statute (10 U.S.C. § 12406) to federalize the Guard, claiming the protests constituted a "rebellion." This broad interpretation, which bypassed the governor, set a dangerous precedent for using military force against civil disobedience, blurring the lines of the Posse Comitatus Act, which normally prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement.</p>
        `,
        solutions: `
            <p class="mb-4">The crisis is a symptom of a profoundly broken U.S. immigration system. Policy experts largely agree on a path forward that moves beyond an ineffective enforcement-only approach.</p>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">1. Disentangle Local & Federal Enforcement</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">End federal programs that deputize local police as immigration agents (like 287(g)) and cease the use of ICE "detainers." This would reduce federal-state friction, rebuild community trust, and allow local police to focus on local public safety priorities.</p>
            
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">2. Shift from Detention to Humane Alternatives</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">Replace costly and punitive detention with effective community-based case management programs. These alternatives are far less expensive (as little as $38/day vs. over $300/day for detention) and have proven highly effective (99-100% compliance) at ensuring individuals appear for their court hearings.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">3. Enact Comprehensive Legislative Reform</h3>
            <p class="mt-1">A multi-pronged strategy is needed to address the root causes. This includes expanding legal immigration pathways to meet labor needs, modernizing the asylum system to process claims efficiently, and providing a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented individuals already integrated into U.S. society. This would regularize the workforce and provide a significant boost to the U.S. economy.</p>
