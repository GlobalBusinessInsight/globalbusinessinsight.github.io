    <!-- Chosen Palette: Somber Teal and Gray -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, chronological analysis of major battles. A sticky top navigation allows users to select a battle from a dropdown, scrolling them to the relevant section. Each battle is a self-contained module with a consistent structure: a summary stats card, a detailed narrative in tabbed panes (Objectives, Timeline, Impact), and a data visualization chart for estimated losses. This modular, tabbed structure is chosen to present dense, multi-faceted information for each battle in a digestible way, preventing overwhelming walls of text while allowing for deep dives into specific aspects. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Goal: Overview of Conflict Timeline -> Interactive Dropdown Navigator. Interaction: Select a battle to scroll to its section. Justification: Provides a quick, scannable index of the war's key ground campaigns, more suitable than a complex chart for this narrative-heavy topic.
        - Goal: Compare Battle Intensity -> Standardized "Key Facts" cards (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: Static display. Justification: Offers a quick, at-a-glance summary of core statistics for each battle, allowing for easy comparison across different sections.
        - Goal: Analyze Battle Losses -> Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) for each battle. Interaction: Tooltips on hover. Justification: Clearly visualizes the scale of estimated personnel and equipment losses for both sides in a compact, easy-to-read format.
        - Goal: Organize Detailed Analysis -> Tabbed Panes (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Click tabs for different analysis categories (Objectives, Timeline, Impact). Justification: Breaks down complex information into thematic chunks, improving readability and user engagement by allowing them to choose their focus.
        - Library/Method: Chart.js on Canvas for visualizations, Vanilla JS for navigation and tabbed content logic. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    <p><strong>Russian Objectives:</strong> The primary goal was a "thunder run" to capture Kyiv within days. This involved a multi-axis advance aiming to encircle the city, seize key infrastructure like Hostomel Airport via an air assault by elite VDV troops, and ultimately force the collapse or surrender of the Ukrainian government.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Ukrainian Objectives:</strong> The strategy was one of determined, mobile defense. The objectives were to prevent encirclement, inflict heavy casualties on advancing Russian columns, disrupt logistics, preserve President Zelenskyy's government in the capital, and rally international support.</p>`,

It was a massive morale boost for Ukraine and galvanized international support.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ukrainian Objectives:</strong> The main strategic goal was to achieve a decisive breakthrough in the south, primarily along the Orikhiv-Tokmak-Melitopol axis. The aim was to sever the Russian "land bridge" to Crimea, splitting Russian forces and undermining their entire southern front.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Russian Objectives:</strong> To defend in depth and defeat the offensive. Russia spent months constructing extensive, multi-layered defensive fortifications (the "Surovikin Line"), including vast minefields, anti-tank ditches, and trench networks, designed to absorb the Ukrainian attack and inflict maximum attrition.</p>`,

                        <li><strong>Early June 2023:</strong> Ukraine launches attacks along multiple axes in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk Oblasts.</li>
                        <li><strong>June-August:</strong> Ukrainian forces, using newly supplied Western armor, struggle to breach the main defensive lines, suffering significant losses in dense minefields and to Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters and Lancet drones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Late August:</strong> Ukraine achieves a tactical success by liberating Robotyne, but fails to exploit the breach further.</li>
                        <li><strong>September-November:</strong> The offensive transitions to a grinding attritional fight with minimal territorial gains. The onset of autumn mud and dwindling resources effectively ends the offensive.</li>

                impact: `
                    <p><strong>Strategic Impact:</strong> The offensive did not achieve its strategic objectives. The inability to breach Russia's prepared defenses was a major setback for Ukraine and led to a period of strategic reassessment and "war weariness" among some Western partners. It highlighted the immense difficulty of conducting large-scale offensive operations against well-prepared defenses.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Russian Success:</strong> For Russia, successfully blunting the offensive was a major defensive victory. It stabilized the front lines, boosted morale, and allowed Russia to regain the strategic initiative heading into 2024.</p>`

                    <p><strong>Russian Objectives:</strong> To capture the heavily fortified city of Avdiivka, a Ukrainian stronghold since 2014 that protruded into Russian-controlled territory near Donetsk city. The capture would be a significant tactical and propaganda victory, pushing the front line away from Donetsk.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Ukrainian Objectives:</strong> To leverage their strong fortifications to inflict massive, unsustainable losses on the attacking Russian forces, similar to the strategy at Bakhmut.

However, it came at an exceptionally high cost in personnel and, especially, armored vehicles. For Ukraine, the withdrawal was a difficult but necessary decision made amid severe ammunition shortages ("shell hunger").</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Tactical Shift:</strong> The battle highlighted Russia's successful adaptation of massive glide bomb (FAB) usage, dropped from standoff range, to systematically obliterate fixed defenses, a tactic that would be used extensively in subsequent operations.</p>`
