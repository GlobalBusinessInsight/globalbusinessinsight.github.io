        </div>

        <h2 class="font-lora !mt-8">The End of an Era</h2>
        <p>The seventy-six-year era of the "Department of Defense" came to an end with the stroke of the presidential pen on an executive order. This action, far more than just changing the sign at the Pentagon's entrance, signals a subversive reshaping of the American military philosophy and global strategy that has been in place since World War II. The tranquility of Washington has been shattered, and a fierce debate over America's national identity, military mission, and role in the world has spilled from academic ivory towers onto the central stage of global politics.</p>
        <p>This report will provide an in-depth analysis of the background and immediate reactions to this historic decision, with a special focus on the driving force behind it: the military doctrine President Trump has gradually formed and implemented across his two terms in office.</p>

        <h2 class="font-lora">A Historical Watershed</h2>
        <p>From "War" to "Defense," and then a dramatic return to "War." The century-long evolution of the name of America's highest military department is a mirror reflecting the evolution and cycles of the nation's strategy.</p>

                <p class="!mt-0">Shortly after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, Congress established the Department of War in 1789. Its primary duty was to manage the army affairs of the new nation. The name directly reflected its core function: handling military operations related to war, making it one of the earliest departments of the federal government.</p>

                <p class="!mt-0">As the smoke of World War II cleared, the Iron Curtain of the Cold War descended. To adapt to a new global strategy, the United States reorganized its military structure with the National Security Act of 1947 and officially renamed its military establishment the "Department of Defense" in 1949. This change was intended to emphasize a defensive posture of deterrence, alliances, and the maintenance of global stability, rather than the active pursuit of war.</p>

                <p class="!mt-0">During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump and his team repeatedly attacked "endless wars" and promised a thorough reform of the "bureaucratic swamp" in Washington, with the Pentagon as a key target. Although the name change was not explicitly proposed, the signals of "America First" and ending foreign interventions laid the groundwork for the subsequent decision.</p>

                <p class="!mt-0">President Trump signed Executive Order 14125, officially reverting the "Department of Defense" to its original name, the "Department of War." A White House statement declared the move was intended to "define in clear language the primary mission of our armed forces: to deter our enemies and, when necessary, to win our nation's wars," and to end an "era of mission creep." The move, which bypassed Congress, was immediately challenged on legal grounds.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="font-lora">Immediate Reactions from Global Media</h2>
        <p>Within hours of the executive order's signing, global media outlets provided intensive coverage and commentary, with opinions polarizing sharply, highlighting the controversial and impactful nature of the move. Here are summaries of the core commentary from major media outlets:</p>
        
        <h3>Associated Press</h3>
        <blockquote>"The White House announced the executive order abruptly on Thursday afternoon, stunning Washington. The order not only changes the name but also directs the new Secretary of War to submit a plan within 90 days to 'divest all non-core combat functions.' Bipartisan leaders in Congress said they received no prior notification, with the Speaker of the House calling it 'a blatant contempt for congressional authority.'"</blockquote>

        <h3>Reuters</h3>
        <blockquote>"The move sent shockwaves through NATO allies. A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, 'This is not just a semantic change; it is a chilling signal about America's commitment to global security.' The U.S. dollar and stock index futures saw a slight dip after the news broke."</blockquote>

        <h3>The New York Times</h3>
        <blockquote>"This is more than a name. It is a decisive turn in American foreign policy, a shift from leader to loner. By redefining the Pentagon as a pure war-fighting machine, the President is undermining the roles of diplomacy, development aid, and alliances, which are the true cornerstones of American security and prosperity."</blockquote>
        
        <h3>The Wall Street Journal</h3>
        <blockquote>"While acknowledging the questionable legality of the executive order, its editorial board argued that this 'shock therapy' might help break the Pentagon's bureaucratic sclerosis... 'Whether you like it or not, Trump is forcing a long-overdue conversation about the true purpose of the military.'"</blockquote>

        <h3>Fox News</h3>
        <blockquote>"Tonight, the President showed the world that America will no longer pay for other people's wars. The name 'Department of War' is honest. It tells our troops their job is to kill our enemies and defend our home, not nation-building overseas. This is the ultimate expression of 'America First.'"</blockquote>
        
        <h3>Xinhua News Agency</h3>
        <blockquote>"The latest move by the U.S. government is another dangerous step in its pursuit of unilateralism and hegemonic policies. This change in name is, in substance, a more direct pretext for its military interventions and is bound to bring more instability to an already turbulent world. The international community should remain highly vigilant."</blockquote>

        <h2 class="font-lora">A Deep Dive into Trump's Military Doctrine</h2>
        <p>Renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War is the inevitable outcome of Trump's military doctrine. This ideology was not born overnight; it began to take shape during his first presidential term and has been aggressively implemented in his current one. It marks a complete break with the bipartisan foreign policy consensus of the past several decades.</p>

        <h3>First Term (2017-2021): Foundations and Probes</h3>
        <p>Trump's first term was a period of laying the groundwork for his disruptive military philosophy, characterized by a constant struggle with the establishment. Its core features can be summarized as follows:</p>
        
        <h4>Transactional Alliances and Global Realignment</h4>
        <p>He viewed traditional military alliances like NATO and pacts with Japan and South Korea as protectionist business deals rather than sacred contracts based on shared values. He repeatedly pressured allies to increase their defense spending, threatening to withdraw the U.S. security umbrella if they failed to do so. His military posture adjustments during this period reflected a clear cost-benefit analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On the EU/NATO:</strong> He publicly questioned the commitment to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause and frequently threatened to withdraw from the alliance over defense spending disputes (particularly with Germany), straining transatlantic relations.</li>
            <li><strong>On Japan and South Korea:</strong> He demanded that Japan and South Korea significantly increase their financial contributions for hosting U.S. troops, at times bringing renewal negotiations to a standstill. This forced both nations to re-evaluate their own defense capabilities and, to some extent, spurred their military modernization.</li>
            <li><strong>On Australia:</strong> Although the U.S.-Australia relationship remained relatively stable, the unpredictability of the Trump administration prompted Australia to seek more diverse security partnerships and strengthen its role in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The Middle East and Afghanistan: An Obsession with Ending "Endless Wars"</h4>
        <p>He strongly opposed long-term U.S. military engagement in the Middle East, viewing it as a "stupid war" that wasted American lives and treasure. His actions were highly personalized and often bypassed traditional decision-making processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Afghanistan Withdrawal:</strong> He initiated direct negotiations with the Taliban and secured a withdrawal agreement, completely marginalizing the Afghan government of the time. This reflected his preference for quick fixes, even at the expense of long-term stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Contraction in the Middle East:</strong> He ordered a partial withdrawal of troops from Syria and reduced the U.S. military presence in Iraq. Concurrently, by brokering the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, he attempted to build a self-sustaining regional security architecture to lessen the American burden.</li>
        </ul>
         <blockquote>"We can no longer be the policeman of the world. We can no longer let everyone take advantage of us. If they don't pay, we have to let them protect themselves." — A typical remark from Trump at campaign rallies.</blockquote>

        <h4>A Veneration and Display of "Strength"</h4>
        <p>He approved massive military budgets and pushed for the creation of the Space Force. The core logic was to deter adversaries by displaying overwhelming military power, thereby avoiding war. However, the "strength" he cared about was more about grand symbols (like military parades and new service branches) than the complex global readiness state emphasized by the establishment.</p>

        <h3>Second Term (2025-): Full Implementation</h3>
        <p>Upon securing a second term, no longer constrained by establishment advisors, Trump began to systematically translate his first-term ideas into concrete actions. Renaming the Department of War was merely the most symbolic step in a series of radical moves.</p>
        
        <h4>Stance on Current Wars: Israel, Ukraine, and Iran</h4>
        <p>Trump's second term saw him engage with global hotspots in a distinctly different manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ukraine:</strong> He completely altered the model of aid to Ukraine. Early in his term, he announced a "final and decisive" massive military aid package, including long-range missiles and F-16 fighter jets that were previously withheld. However, he simultaneously issued an ultimatum to both Kyiv and Moscow: reach a ceasefire agreement within 120 days, or the United States would permanently halt all military assistance. He framed this as "peace through strength," aiming to forcibly end the war rather than pursue a complete victory for Ukraine.</li>
            <li><strong>Israel and Iran:</strong> He granted Israel "unrestricted" freedom of military action in Gaza and regional conflicts. Meanwhile, upon receiving intelligence that Iran's nuclear program had achieved a breakthrough, he authorized a precision strike codenamed "Operation Daybreak." Executed jointly by U.S. and Israeli air forces, the operation carried out devastating airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz and Fordow. The White House described it as a model of "ending a threat, not starting a war." Subsequently, in retaliation for attacks on international shipping by Iranian-backed Houthi forces, the U.S. military conducted a week of intense airstrikes on Houthi military targets, far exceeding the scale of previous "self-defense" responses.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>As the "Mediator": A Trump-Style Peace</h4>
        <p>Corresponding with his desire to avoid "endless wars," Trump was keen to play the role of the ultimate dealmaker, seeking quick, historic diplomatic breakthroughs, even if the agreements lacked a solid foundation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>India-Pakistan Conflict:</strong> When tensions flared again in the Kashmir region, Trump proactively intervened, inviting the prime ministers of both countries to Camp David. Using a "transactional" mix of tariff threats and promises of economic aid, he brokered a "temporary de-escalation agreement." Though its details were vague, it momentarily prevented a wider conflict and was hailed by the White House as a Nobel Peace Prize-worthy achievement.</li>
            <li><strong>Southeast Asia and Africa:</strong> For a border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia, he dispatched a special envoy who used U.S. trade preferences as leverage to quickly secure a memorandum of understanding. For internal conflicts in Africa (such as in the Sahel region), he showed great impatience and disinterest, unless the conflict directly threatened U.S. interests in rare earth minerals or counter-terrorism outposts. His mediations were entirely opportunistic and interest-driven.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="!text-xl">The Military and Weaponry: Reshaped for an "America First" War</h3>
        <p>The military reforms of his second term, from personnel to equipment, all revolved around a single core objective: to forge a leaner, more lethal fighting force entirely dedicated to America's unilateral interests.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Loyalty" in Personnel:</strong> He appointed ideologically aligned officials like Christopher Miller to lead the Department of War, aiming to eradicate what he perceived as the "deep state's" influence within the military.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaponry Focused on "Great Wars":</strong> Budgets for counter-terrorism and low-intensity conflict equipment were drastically cut, with funds redirected to projects aimed at deterring great-power rivals, such as hypersonic missiles and nuclear modernization.</li>
            <li><strong>"Americanized" Supply Chains:</strong> Citing national security, he mandated the reshoring of supply chains for key weapons systems like the F-35, aiming to bolster domestic manufacturing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="font-lora">Voices from Inside and Outside the Pentagon</h2>
        <p>As soon as the executive order was issued, former Secretaries of Defense who once led this vast institution voiced their opinions, forming clear camps of support and opposition.</p>
        
        <div class="space-y-6">
            <div>
                <h3 class="!text-xl">Christopher Miller (Acting SecDef, Trump Admin.) - <span class="text-green-700">Publicly Supportive</span></h3>

                <p>"This is a reckless and destructive decision. It ignores the department's broad functions in deterrence, alliance management, and humanitarian aid. It will create confusion for our friends and foes alike, ultimately harming American security."</p>

                <p>Stated through a spokesperson: "Words matter. To relegate our Department of Defense to a Department of War is a departure from the founding principles of our nation and sends a deeply flawed signal to the world. It will make the work of diplomacy infinitely harder."</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="!text-xl">Lloyd Austin (SecDef, Biden Admin.) - <span class="text-red-800">Expressed Disappointment</span></h3>
                <p>"The mission of the Department of Defense is to defend our nation, and deterring conflict is just as important as winning wars. This name change unwisely narrows the mission of our armed forces and could be maliciously exploited by our adversaries."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="font-lora">Immediate and Future Implications</h2>
        <p>The ripple effects of this executive order have already begun to manifest and will continue to evolve in the coming months and years, profoundly affecting America's domestic politics and foreign relations.</p>

        <h3>Legal and Political Battles</h3>
        <p>Congress has initiated emergency hearings, and legal experts are fiercely debating whether the president has the unilateral authority to change the name of a department established by an Act of Congress. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is expected to file a lawsuit to block the executive order, setting the stage for a fierce battle between the White House and Capitol Hill.</p>

        <h3>International Repercussions</h3>
        <p>The NATO Secretary General has called for an emergency meeting of member states, while Asian allies like Japan and South Korea are urgently seeking clarification from the U.S. through diplomatic channels about whether its security commitments have changed. Russian and Chinese state media have declared this as proof that America is "shedding its disguise." The global diplomatic landscape is facing new uncertainties.</p>

        <h3>Internal Military Restructuring</h3>
        <p>The new "Department of War" is expected to undergo an internal reorganization, prioritizing resources and status for combat units. The future roles and budgets of Cyber Command, Space Force, and departments responsible for humanitarian aid and peacekeeping missions are under immense pressure, and morale within the military has become visibly divided.</p>
        
        <h2 class="font-lora">Text of the Executive Order</h2>
        
        <div class="eo-document">
            <h3 class="!text-2xl !mb-4">EXECUTIVE ORDER 14125</h3>
            <h3 class="!text-xl !mb-8">ON THE REORGANIZATION AND RENAMING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR</h3>
            
            <p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure peak effectiveness of our nation’s military forces, to clarify their core mission, and to make plain to the American people and to the world their fundamental purpose, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Section 1. Policy.</strong> For more than seventy years, the name "Department of Defense" has obscured the primary and most solemn duty of our armed forces: to be prepared for war and, when deterrence fails, to win our Nation's wars with decisive force. A persistent "mission creep" has diverted precious resources from core lethality to nation-building, climate change studies, and endless overseas constabulary actions. This era of bureaucratic euphemism is over. To put the safety and sovereignty of America first, we must define the mission of our military establishment with unambiguous clarity. A return to the historic name, the "Department of War," is an admission of reality and a clear warning to any potential adversary: the armed forces of the United States exist to fight and win.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sec. 2. Change of Name.</strong></p>
            <p>(a) All references to the "Department of Defense" in the Executive Branch shall be changed to the "Department of War."</p>
            <p>(b) The title of the Secretary of Defense shall be amended to the Secretary of War.</p>

            <p><strong>Sec. 3. Mission Reset and Review.</strong></p>
